# ComputerNotifications
Computer Notifications For Mac
App that will notify you for certain events you have during the day
Keep code running by using the following command on terminal: caffeinate -s python3 main.py
Meant for Mac but if you have windows, instead of the whole notify function I made, you can install winotify and use winotify instead. You can also check power options on the control panel on Windows because caffeinating the computer won't work on Windows.
